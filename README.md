# Enhanced Ontology-RAG System

## Project Overview

This repository contains an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates structured ontologies with language models. The system demonstrates how formal ontological knowledge representation can enhance traditional vector-based retrieval methods to provide more accurate, contextually rich, and logically consistent answers to user queries.

The project implements a sophisticated architecture that combines:

- JSON-based ontology representation with classes, relationships, rules, and instances  
- Knowledge graph visualization for exploring entity relationships  
- Semantic path finding for multi-hop reasoning between concepts  
- Comparative analysis between traditional vector-based RAG and ontology-enhanced RAG  

The application is built with **Streamlit** for the frontend interface, uses **FAISS** for vector embeddings, **NetworkX** for graph representation, and integrates with **OpenAI's language models** for generating responses.

## Key Features

1. **RAG Comparison Demo**
   - Side-by-side comparison of traditional and ontology-enhanced RAG
   - Analysis of differences in answers and retrieved context

2. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**
   - Interactive network graph for exploring the ontology structure
   - Multiple layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, radial, circular)
   - Entity relationship exploration with customizable focus

3. **Ontology Structure Analysis**
   - Visualization of class hierarchies and statistics
   - Relationship usage and domain-range distribution analysis
   - Graph statistics including node counts, edge counts, and centrality metrics

4. **Entity Exploration**
   - Detailed entity information cards showing properties and relationships
   - Relationship graphs centered on specific entities
   - Neighborhood exploration for entities

5. **Semantic Path Visualization**
   - Path visualization between entities with step-by-step explanation
   - Visual representation of paths through the knowledge graph
   - Connection to relevant business rules

6. **Reasoning Trace Visualization**
   - Query analysis with entity and relationship detection
   - Sankey diagrams showing information flow in the RAG process
   - Explanation of reasoning steps

## Ontology Structure Example

The `data/enterprise_ontology.json` file contains a rich enterprise ontology that models organizational knowledge. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### Classes (Entity Types)

The ontology defines a hierarchical class structure with inheritance relationships. For example:

- **Entity** (base class)
  - **FinancialEntity** ‚Üí Budget, Revenue, Expense  
  - **Asset** ‚Üí PhysicalAsset, DigitalAsset, IntellectualProperty  
  - **Person** ‚Üí InternalPerson ‚Üí Employee ‚Üí Manager  
  - **Process** ‚Üí BusinessProcess, DevelopmentProcess, SupportProcess  
  - **Market** ‚Üí GeographicMarket, DemographicMarket, BusinessMarket  

Each class has a description and a set of defined properties. For instance, the `Employee` class includes properties like role, hire date, and performance rating.

### Relationships

The ontology defines explicit relationships between entity types, including:

- `ownedBy`: Connects Product to Department  
- `managedBy`: Connects Department to Manager  
- `worksOn`: Connects Employee to Product  
- `purchases`: Connects Customer to Product  
- `provides`: Connects Customer to Feedback  
- `optimizedBy`: Relates Product to Feedback  

Each relationship has metadata such as domain, range, cardinality, and inverse relationship name.

### Business Rules

The ontology contains formal business rules that constrain the knowledge model:

- "Every Product must be owned by exactly one Department"  
- "Every Department must be managed by exactly one Manager"  
- "Critical support tickets must be assigned to Senior employees or managers"  
- "Product Lifecycle stages must follow a predefined sequence"  

### Instances

The ontology includes concrete instances of the defined classes, such as:

- `product1`: An "Enterprise Analytics Suite" owned by the Engineering department  
- `manager1`: A director named "Jane Smith" who manages the Engineering department  
- `customer1`: "Acme Corp" who has purchased product1 and provided feedback  

Each instance has properties and relationships to other instances, forming a connected knowledge graph.

This structured knowledge representation allows the system to perform semantic reasoning beyond what would be possible with simple text-based approaches, enabling it to answer complex queries that require understanding of hierarchical relationships, business rules, and multi-step connections between entities.

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
The ontology-enhanced RAG system can help organizations effectively organize and access their knowledge assets, connecting information across different departments and systems to provide more comprehensive business insights.

### Product Development Decision Support
By understanding the relationships between customer feedback, product features, and market data, the system can provide more valuable support for product development decisions.

### Complex Compliance Queries
In compliance scenarios where multiple rules and relationships need to be considered, the ontology-enhanced RAG can provide rule-based reasoning to ensure recommendations comply with all applicable policies and regulations.

### Diagnostics and Troubleshooting
In technical support and troubleshooting scenarios, the system can connect symptoms, causes, and solutions through multi-hop reasoning to provide more accurate diagnoses.
