# Ontology-Enhanced RAG System

## Project Overview

This repository contains an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates structured ontologies with language models. The system demonstrates how formal ontological knowledge representation can enhance traditional vector-based retrieval methods to provide more accurate, contextually rich, and logically consistent answers to user queries.

![Ontology-RAG System](https://github.com/AD2000X/ontology-rag/blob/main/images/11.jpg)

The project implements a sophisticated architecture that combines:

- JSON-based ontology representation with classes, relationships, rules, and instances  
- Knowledge graph visualization for exploring entity relationships  
- Semantic path finding for multi-hop reasoning between concepts  
- Comparative analysis between traditional vector-based RAG and ontology-enhanced RAG  

## Technology Stack

This application uses a comprehensive tech stack:

## Ontology Structure

The `data/enterprise_ontology.json` file contains a rich enterprise ontology that models organizational knowledge. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### Classes (Entity Types)

The ontology defines a hierarchical class structure with inheritance relationships:

```
Entity (base class)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FinancialEntity ‚Üí Budget, Revenue, Expense
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Asset ‚Üí PhysicalAsset, DigitalAsset, IntellectualProperty
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Person ‚Üí InternalPerson ‚Üí Employee ‚Üí Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Process ‚Üí BusinessProcess, DevelopmentProcess, SupportProcess
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Market ‚Üí GeographicMarket, DemographicMarket, BusinessMarket
```

Each class has a description and a set of defined properties.

### Relationships

The ontology defines explicit relationships between entity types, including:

- `ownedBy`: Connects Product to Department
- `managedBy`: Connects Department to Manager
- `worksOn`: Connects Employee to Product
- `purchases`: Connects Customer to Product
- `provides`: Connects Customer to Feedback
- `optimizedBy`: Relates Product to Feedback

Each relationship has metadata such as domain, range, cardinality, and inverse relationship name.

### Business Rules

The ontology contains formal business rules that constrain the knowledge model:

- "Every Product must be owned by exactly one Department"
- "Every Department must be managed by exactly one Manager"
- "Critical support tickets must be assigned to Senior employees or managers"
- "Product Lifecycle stages must follow a predefined sequence"

### Instances

The ontology includes concrete instances of the defined classes, such as:

- `product1`: An "Enterprise Analytics Suite" owned by the Engineering department
- `manager1`: A director named "Jane Smith" who manages the Engineering department
- `customer1`: "Acme Corp" who has purchased product1 and provided feedback

## Getting Started

- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ontology-rag.git
   cd ontology-rag
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Option 1: Set as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Option 2: Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with:

     ```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will start and open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

### Using the Application

1. **Starting Point**: Begin with the "RAG comparison demonstration" to understand the basic difference between traditional and ontology-enhanced RAG
2. **Exploration**: Use the "Knowledge graph visualization" and "Entity exploration" to understand the ontology structure
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Try "Semantic path visualization" to see how entities connect to each other
4. **Performance Comparison**: Use "Detailed comparative analysis" to dive deeper into the differences between approaches

## Extending the System

### Creating Your Own Ontology

To use the system with your custom ontology:

1. Create a JSON file following the structure in `data/enterprise_ontology.json`
2. Your ontology should define:
   - `classes`: Entity types with properties and inheritance relationships
   - `relationships`: Connection types between entities
   - `rules`: Business rules and constraints
   - `instances`: Concrete examples of entities

3. Update the OntologyManager initialization in `app.py`:
   ```python
   ontology_manager = OntologyManager("data/your_ontology.json")
   ```

### Adding More Data Sources

To expand the system's knowledge:

1. Create a text representation of your ontology to create embeddings
2. Add additional text chunks when initializing the SemanticRetriever:
   ```python
   semantic_retriever = SemanticRetriever(
       ontology_manager=ontology_manager,
       text_chunks=your_additional_text_chunks
   )
   ```

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Knowledge Management

The ontology-enhanced RAG system helps organizations effectively organize and access their knowledge assets:

- **Knowledge Integration**: Connect information across different departments and systems
- **Relationship Discovery**: Identify non-obvious connections between business entities
- **Consistent Answers**: Ensure responses adhere to organizational policies and rules

Implementation steps:
1. Model your organization's knowledge as an ontology
2. Define key entity types (products, departments, employees, etc.)
3. Establish relationships between entities
4. Add business rules as constraints
5. Populate with representative instances

### Product Development Decision Support

Support product development decisions by connecting customer feedback, product features, and market data:

- **Feedback Analysis**: Trace how customer feedback influences product features
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand how changes affect downstream dependencies
- **Cross-Department Collaboration**: Connect marketing insights with development priorities

Implementation steps:
1. Define product, feature, and feedback entities in your ontology
2. Establish relationships between customer feedback and product components
3. Create semantic paths connecting market data to development initiatives
4. Use the RAG comparison to answer development strategy questions

### Complex Compliance Queries

Ensure recommendations comply with all applicable policies and regulations:

- **Rule-Based Reasoning**: Apply multiple constraints simultaneously
- **Audit Trails**: Show reasoning paths to demonstrate compliance
- **Policy Connections**: Link entities to relevant regulatory requirements

Implementation steps:
1. Add compliance rules to your ontology
2. Create relationships between regulated entities and relevant policies
3. Use semantic path visualization to trace compliance relationships
4. Query the system about specific compliance scenarios

### Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

Connect symptoms, causes, and solutions through multi-hop reasoning:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace issues through connected systems
- **Solution Recommendation**: Find relevant fixes based on symptom patterns
- **Component Relationship Mapping**: Understand dependencies between system components

Implementation steps:
1. Model system components and their relationships
2. Define typical symptoms and their possible causes
3. Link solutions to specific problem patterns
4. Use the semantic path visualization to trace from symptoms to solutions
